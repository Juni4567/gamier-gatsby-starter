In this tutorial, I am going to show you how to remove footer copyright text from faster template by templatesyard free blogger template. You need to have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. If you are comfortable with these three languages and want to learn something interesting then follow along. You are lazy like me? you can have the nulled version of templatesyard free blogger template. Simply just like our Facebook page and subscribe to our news feed. Send us a message and we will email the nulled faster template to you real quick, promise ;). You can view live Demo of the nulled faster theme.

## **Step 1: Install the faster template by templatesyard free blogger template**

You need to have the free version of the theme installed. Don’t worry if you don’t want to test this on your main blog. You can simply create a new blog and install the free version of the faster template there. After installing the faster template you need to view your blog to see the template applied. 

**Open** your blog URL or you can find the** VIEW Blog** button on your blogger admin top left area in blogger admin.

> **NOTE:**
>
>  EDITING BLOGGER THEME DIRECTLY IN THE BROWSER IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. YOU NEED A CODE EDITOR E.G. SUBLIME TEXT TO EDIT YOUR TEMPLATE. PLEASE BACKUP YOUR CURRENT THEME BEFORE YOU START EDITING.

There are three blocks of code you need to replace to successfully change the footer copyright text without a redirect. Remember if you miss step you’ll have the redirect, so do it with full attention.

## **Step 2: Search for some encrypted code in your theme’s HTML code (block 1)**

This one was a hard nut to crack haha. I spent around 3 hours to figure it out. Go to your blogger admin and select theme -> edit HTML and search for eval(function or goto line number 115. Now select the code starting from eval(function till x4D'.split('|')))(inclusive) and press delete button. No worries that’s bad code and I have the alternative. Do not close the window and don’t scroll away cause we need to fill the space with some good in the following snippet.

```
// First step code block
```

```
