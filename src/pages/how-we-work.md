## How we work

In order to be the most cost-effective service, we offer several collaboration models depending on your project size and specific requirements.

Here’s an insight into our process and approach to working on your product.

## Cooperation models

<div class="container has-text-centered">
<div class="columns is-multiline">
<div class="column is-6">
<h2>Dedicated team</h2>
If you’re building a product from the ground up or scaling an existing solution that requires ongoing development, we recommend getting a dedicated team. You can manage the team yourself or let us do it for you.

</div>
<div class="column is-6">
<h2>Time and material
</h2>
This model is great for smaller projects up to 3 months when there’s a quite defined scope of work. You still get a team together with a project manager and a QA specialist, however, you only pay for the hours spent and can stop whenever you wish.

## What happens when you get in touch with us

Our mission is to find out everything about the solution you are looking to build, suggest the right approach, come up with estimation and move forward with the development of your product. Here’s a closer look at our process.
